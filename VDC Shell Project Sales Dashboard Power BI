I'm thrilled to have worked on a full-stack data analysis project where I got to unravel data and provide insights into the sales revenue of different products for Best Cart Mini Carts. 

These were the objectives I followed to create the dashboard attached below: 
1. Identified and fixed quality issues in the dataset
2. Used the sales data to view the share of each category and product in the overall sales. Furthermore, I created charts, worked out percentages and outlined trends for last year.
3. I created visualisations to portray seasonal products.
4. Assessed which products have drastic peaks and figured out why, looking at data available on the internet, such as holidays, weather conditions, etc.I'm thrilled to have worked on a full-stack data analysis project where I got to unravel data and provide insights into the sales revenue of different products for Best Cart Mini Carts.
